# Book Search Engine

## Description

Are you a fan of reading? Well I sure hope so, cause that's exactly what this app is good for! Recently learning about GraphQL API's and Apollo server, this app aims to showcase a successful MERN stack. I will be refactoring the provided code to ensure successful integration with GraphQL, Apollo and a live deployment via Render. Although the starter code is not my own work, all of my code additions/removals will be showcased in my associated GitHub repository.

The overall UI/UX experience will focus on search capabilities with associated book images and information. The goal for a happy path is that the user can login, successfully submit their book search, and instantaneously see relevant book data with jpeg images, descriptions, and a "Save This Book!" button. Additionally, users will be able to navigate to a "See Your Books" page where all their stored saved book data will populate. They can also logout via a button in the navbar.

## Deployment Link

This app is being deployed publicly via Render. If you would like to simply view the functionality of the app without building it locally, you can do so at this link: .

## Installation

Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure bcrypt, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, pg, sequelize and npm are all installed. Because this code base uses TypeScript, be mindful of npm scripts used to run and build the app in the package.json file. Npm install is needed, but it should be noted that npm run render-build will have additional functionality, aside from simply performing an npm install. Upon doing so, the user should be redirected to a live localhost deployment. This app will also be deployed via Render.

It should be noted that I was given starter code by means of the school. From there, I completed the necessary refactors to ensure seamless config with Apollo server and GraphQL.
